                    <h3>Africa Speaks</h3>
                    <p>Africa Speaks, to be released June 7th, 2019 goes deeper and further than ever before to create
                        one
                        of the most groundbreaking albums yet. Enlisting legendary producer Rick Rubin, Santana and his
                        band
                        convened at Rubin’s Shangri La Studios in Malibu, and recorded an astonishing number of tracks,
                        many
                        of them in one take. Another dramatic element in the creation of Africa Speaks came in the form
                        of
                        Spanish singer Buika, whose heavenly lead vocals cast a magical spell throughout the album,

                        recently told the Rolling Stone Music Now podcast about one of the strangest things about
                        communicating on the regular with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame guitarist. <a

                    <h3>Carlos Santana on the Power of ‘The Mona Lisa,’ Today’s New Hippies</h3>
                    <p>Although Carlos Santana has been playing concerts in Paris since the early Seventies, he never
                        set foot inside the Louvre until 2016. In fact, when his family asked if he wanted to go there,
                        he asked, “What’s there?” “They said, ‘Oh, my God, man. You can spend a whole year in there,'”
                        he recalls. “‘There’s Egyptian stuff and The Mona Lisa.’ I go, like, ‘Oh, OK.'” He was blown
                        away just by the line to get in. “It was like a line you’d see for Beyoncé, Taylor Swift,
                        Rihanna or Adele,” he says, amazement still in his voice. “I was like, ‘Damn, Mona Lisa’s really
                        popular worldwide to this day.” <a
