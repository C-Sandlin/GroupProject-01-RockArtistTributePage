        <h2>Carlos Santana's Extensive Career</h2>
      </section>
      <section class="page__content">
        <p>Born on July 20, 1947, in Autlán de Navarro, Mexico, Carlos Santana moved to San Francisco in the early
          1960s, where he formed the Santana Blues Band in 1966. The band, later simply known as Santana, signed a
          contract with Columbia Records, with Carlos becoming the consistent front man. Throughout the 1970s and early
          '80s, Santana released a string of successful albums such as Abraxas, Lotus and Amigos, making a big comeback
          in 1999 with the Grammy-winning Supernatural. In 2009, he received a Billboard Lifetime Achievement Award and
          several years later became a Kennedy Center Honors recipient. More recent albums have included Corazón and
          Santana IV.</p>
